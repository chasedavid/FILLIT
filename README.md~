# FILLIT


10/23
- AH: Program currently reads testpieces1.txt and stores tetriminos into *linked_list

WIP - need to check for empty rows and columns, shift tetrimino to upper left, and verify that piece is a valid tetrimino

WIP - checkbufchar does not validate correctly

10.25
- CD: We can maybe implement a counter, create a function that interates through to make sure there are no invalid inputs in isvalid piece. also repush so I can pull the working file. ;)
