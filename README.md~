TASKS
[X] [AH] Ability to read text file and store pieces into *linked_list
[ ] [AH] edit lstappend() to assign a char ('A') to each tetrimino *10/25 Current Task*
[ ] [CD] lstpop() function - this will pop first link (piece) in list and append to end so that algorithm can try fitting pieces by placing the next piece in the top left corner

NOTES
10.25
- CD: We can maybe implement a counter, create a function that interates through to make sure there are no invalid inputs in isvalid piece. also repush so I can pull the working file. ;)
